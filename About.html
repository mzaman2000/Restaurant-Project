						Collective Cuisine began as a catering company in 2001 and has since grown into one of the city's first and most popular Bangladeshi restaurants. Collective Cuisine has maintained its high-quality ingredients and consistency in serving Halal Bangladeshi cuisine with well-known Indian and Pakistani dishes (a.k.a. "Desi cuisine") over the years. It was one of the first restaurants in New York to serve dishes like Kacchi Byriani and Hajir Biryani, and it continues to serve these exquisite meals while searching for the next delectable dish that would transport you back to your childhood.Collective Cuisine Restaurant has become a household name not only in New York, but also in other states, thanks to sustained community engagement and support, as well as a long track record of catering large and small events.
